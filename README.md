## Labcodes' Workshop on Object-Oriented Programming

This workshop if focused on addressing some important concepts of OOP such as messaging, SOLID and strategic design. This workshop depends on having Processing and Processing's Python mode enabled in your machine. We decided to use Processing to be closer to a pure Python code as possible and also to enable a more ludic example instead of a formal OOP example (payment systems, notifications systems and so on).

The workshop starts with the discussion around an existing code that implements the following structure:

![Example 000](out.gif)

What the code does is:
  - it defines a virtual square
  - it moves 2 points, with random speeds, along the square's edges
  - it draws a line connecting the two points
                                                                                                                                                                                                              :

The workshop idea is to evolve this base structure in terms of new features that will force us to introduce changes. Those changes should lead us to discuss about OOP topics and strategies to implement them. After each round of coding, the team must get together and dicuss the different approaches used.
